Within this directory are the sounds and graphics from 1992's beloved
"Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters" by Fred Ford and Paul Reiche
III, published by Accolade.

At some point Toys for Bob (Ford and Reiche's company) open sourced
portion of the Star Control II game, leading to the open source
Ur-Quan Masters project:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sc2/files/UQM/

Included are the original game themes for various screens in MOD
format, and WAV files of various star ship and alien species sound
effects.

Some of these are repurposed for the sound design of our game, see
sound/defaults.txt. You may override the sounds or play muted with the
--mute option to mm4obs.

These files were not present at all during the MechMania IV coding
contest, which had no sound and used the default graphics of teal and
orange for ships.
