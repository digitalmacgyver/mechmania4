#  project. Please ignore.

Major old behaviors changed:

  * 5x costing error for Ship Thurst orders than documented (although
    there is a suspicious 1/6th cost factor in allocating thrust, so
    maybe the end result was what was desired and it combined the
    costing error with a discount elsehwere).

  * Velocity Clamping Error - The velocity clamping approach did
    asymetrical things depending on the exect headings and thrust -
    and could even accelerate ships above the limit! Now velocity is
    clamped to 30 by:
    a. Compute the total velocity vector given by current_v + thrust
    b. Truncate the vector to the region inside our "velocity circle"
       whose radius is the game world's max speed.
    b. Charge an additional fuel penalty equal to the amount of
       thrust this truncation effectively gives to the ship "for free."

  * Collision Detection - Proper minimal time to intercept
    calculations. Previously the collision detection for A and B
    projected their relative velocity out from A a distance equal to
    their separation, and saw if that point was a collision. This
    approach is was not robust and would miss glancing collisions from
    oblique angles.

  * TBF - Colliding with an asteroid you eat causes you the same damage as if not (perhaps intentional?!?)

  * Bug to be verified and fixed - fixed Engine bug - You can "double spend" fuel by
  putting it into shields and thrusting or turning if your result of
  both operations would be zero or negative? Check if true CShip::Drift. NOTE: I might have already fixed this?!?


==================================

========================== GAME PHYSICS AND CONSTANTS QUICK REFERENCE ====================

Asteroid radius: 3+1.6*sqrt(mass)
Ship radius: 12
Station radius:

Maxspeed = 30
Game world is 2-D toroid with x, y are in [-512,512)
Items have an orientation, which is in [-PI, PI) with 0 to the right / eastward.

Asteroid mass:
 * >= minmass = 3.0
 * Typically either 40 (our games creation size), or 40/3 (after first break) or 40/9 (after second break). Other sizes are possible due to ships jettisoning different amounts

Ship mass:
 * Empty mass = 40
 * Total mass = 40 + fuel tons on board + vinyl tons on board

Items take damage by colliding with masses:
Ships colliding with laser: Remaining laser mass / 1000 damage
Ships colliding with ship or asteroid: Magnitude of relative velocity between ship and the other thing * mass of the other thing / 1000

Lasers are modeled as colliding masses for damage purposes.
  * Max beam length: 512
  * Beam fuel cost: 1 ton of fuel per 50 units of length
  * Beam collision mass: 30 * (L - D) where L is the total beam length, and D is the distance along the beam before collision
    * (internally this is handled by replacing beam strikes with temporary beam objects that originate 1 unit away from the center of the target along the mean line)

========================== ENGINE TODO ============================================

1. Look around for other constants that would be better off handled in GlobalConstants.h.

1. Get rid of Parser.C/.h - look for other unused files but be more careful with those as we want to preserve some of the stuff for historic interest.

* Game fix of collision eat bug - colliding with an asteroid you can
  eat shouldn't cause any shield damage (but it does). (Add this to our flagged behavior under a category of behavior fixes, as this isn't strictly a physics fix)

4. The announcer says we took 2.2 damage from hitting the asteroid at
6 seconds, however we should have captured that one I think (maybe a
uranium was right in front of a vinyl?!?) - check code - do asteroid
collisions cause damage when we capture them?

Q. Our CONTEST_RULES.md says stations take minor vinyl stores damage from asteroid collisions - is this true?

Q. Our CONTEST_RULES.md says "Teams do NOT know:
- Enemy ships' fuel levels
- Enemy ships' cargo contents
- Enemy ships' shield levels" Is that true?

Q. Our CONTEST_RULES says there are tie breakers - are there?

Fix turning bug where we do for each dt tick:
fuelcons = SetOrder( full_turn )
fuel -= fuelcons * dt
omega = full_turn
... many lines later
rotateShip( omega*dt )
This has bugs when we are low on fuel.

Q. Physics engine: drift is called every 0.2 ticks, it looks to me like ship.Drift doesn't clear O_TURN and O_THURST orders when drifing and generally does the right stuff in terms of multiplying displacement and orientation changes by dt=0.2; however: Does the code in SetJettison do this propertly? Or are we getting ~5x the accelerated kick of out Set Jettison as we should?

  Q. Check if Ship::AngleToIntercept differs from Groogroo's angle turning - it seems like it makes the wrong angle to intercept in that it finds the angle you'd need to be at in 1 turn to be flying towards the target, but if your velocity isn't zero that won't be quite right.

  Q. Caan yhou reconfigure ship capacity after start? At any time? While docked? If so, should we add a game mode to cc_claude where you can't?

  Q. If station radius is 30, or in general if ship+station radius > x, how does launching handle not immediately collidign / redocking?

  Q. Double check that Coord DistTo and AngleTo produce proper toroidal measures with some test cases and a hello_world style program that just runs these functions.

  Q. How accurate is the physics simulation:
     * Conservetion of energy on collision / thrus
     * Conservation of momentum on collision / thrust
  
  Q. CTraj::Rotate noramlizes - does this reduce the cost? what if someone wants to do a spinarooney and puts in a rotate of 1000*PI?

Engine enhancements:
  * Physically costed rotation based on assumption of linear accel and decel to change angle X and end up at a dead stop? (Normalized to physicall acceleration costs?)
  * Momentum handling on jettison
  * Review momentum handling on laser strike
  * Momentum handling on collision
  * asteroid mass correctly correlates with volume? Or I guess we're in 2d so area is OK?
  * Our ship collision logic deals damage to us based on our relative velocity with the thing we collide, and that things mass, our mass doesn't matter. Is this a "momentum swap" or normal physical / collision type? If not maybe adjust it.

* We do change momentum when capturing an asteroid, but this is OK - see if we conserve momentum or not - we should correctly conserve momentum. (This is a physics fix if we need to make one).

Ship.C HandleJettison : Conserve momentum in ship ejecting an asteroid - as it is the asteroid leaves with our velocity, and we slow down some (which doesn't conserve momentum), and als owe just place the asteroid out a bit to avoid collisiono - that part is fine (Alghout maybe it hsould be placed more 3+ship radius or something rather than 3!?!?

???????????? LASER TARGETING BUG ?????????????????????????
  Q. Is there a bug in LaserTarget?
     * We check if we are IsFacing, but we compare distance with DistTo which uses toroidal aware distance, and may not be the distance in the direction we're facing.
     * Also, the interface here seems confusing - if mindist > dlaspwr then we're not actually going to hit anything - we are just aiming at something too far away - so when that happens do we want to know that, or do we want to get that we're not aiming at anything.
  * AS PHRASED TO GTP-T HIGH: Is there a subtle bug in CShip::LaserTarget whereby both IsFacing and DistTo use toroid aware geometry, and so will report that a Ship is facing a target only if it is facing it along the shortest path to the target?
  E.g. if a ship is at (-400, 0) and is oriented with theta = 0 (facing rightward), and an asteroid is at (400, 0), won’t LaserTarget return false for that ship?

Now - it just so happens in our implementation that the maximum laser distance is 512 units, so in practice this might not matter much - however the logic for LaserTarget considers the case where a laser can’t reach the target and reports that yes, it is facing that target when it believes IsFacing is true - so at the least this seems inconsistent.
===END GTP-5 QUERY===

=== GTP ANSWER ===
Short answer: Yes, that subtlety is real.

What happens

- Toroid-shortest facing: CThing::IsFacing uses the shortest-wrap vector (CCoord::AngleTo/VectTo). So a ship at (-400, 0) facing θ=0
with a target at (400, 0) is deemed “not facing” (shortest vector is left, x = −224), and LaserTarget will ignore it. If the ship
faces θ=π, IsFacing returns true and the target can be selected.
- Range mismatch: CShip::LaserTarget picks the nearest facing target even if it’s out of range; it only clamps dLaserDist for UI. It
does not null the target when mindist > laser power.
- Flawed range check later: World::LaserModel then “validates” range using DistTo(ship, LasPos), but LasPos was constructed as ship +
(L, orient). DistTo there is the shortest toroidal distance and will be ≤ L by construction, so the range check almost never rejects.
If the true shortest distance to the target D > L, the code still proceeds and computes laser “mass” as 30*(L − D), which can be
negative.

Impact

- Your example (800 along the long way) is unreachable anyway because max laser length is clamped to 512, so ignoring it is
consistent with range. But the inconsistency remains: LaserTarget says “facing” based on shortest-path alignment, not on whether the
forward ray can reach the target; and out‑of‑range targets can slip through to LaserModel, producing negative laser mass.
- Side effect: Stations subtract cargo by mass/1000. A negative mass would increase station cargo. That’s a real bug path when
mindist > L but IsFacing is true.

Minimal fixes (pick one)

- Enforce range in target selection: In CShip::LaserTarget, skip targets with DistTo > current laser power (retain dLaserDist for
UI).
- Correct the range check: In CWorld::LaserModel, replace the DistTo(ship, LasPos) check with an along-ray test. Compute dir =
unit(GetOrient()); for candidate target center c (consider 9 toroidal images c + (iW, jH)), project r = (c − ship) onto dir: t =
dot(r, dir), d_perp = |cross(r, dir)|. Require 0 ≤ t ≤ L and d_perp ≤ target.size; pick the smallest t. If none hit, treat as out
of range.

If you’d like, I can patch LaserTarget to filter by range (simple, low risk), or implement the proper ray-cast (robust and consistent
with wrap-around).

Q8. Question 8: LaserTarget and Toroidal Geometry
Your interpretation is correct. CShip::LaserTarget relies on IsFacing, which uses CCoord subtraction to find the shortest path vector across the torus.
In your example (Ship at -400 facing East, Target at 400), the shortest path is West. IsFacing returns FALSE. The ship cannot target the "long way around."
This is consistent in practice because the laser range is capped at 512 units (half the world size).
Subtle Bug (The Antipode): There is an edge case bug when the target is exactly halfway across the world (distance 512). At this point, there are multiple equally valid shortest paths (e.g., East and West). CCoord normalization arbitrarily chooses one. If the ship is facing the target along one shortest path, but CCoord normalization chooses the opposite path, IsFacing will return FALSE, preventing the laser from firing despite correct alignment. 


????????????????? LASER BUG ???????????????????

  Q. Verify undocking thrust and turn cost are not gated by fuel tank size in engine (or document if they are).

  Q. The undocking logic wiht dDockDist seems a big mess - both the bad Cursor AI and Codex say it has something to do with recording the center to center distance from prior docking and sending the ship out on that trajectory or something (maybe so ships can dock -> launch without taking a game turn to rotate and if so they head out the way they came in? This seems to open the door to accidental redocking on low velockty exits. Shouldn't all initial velocities for docked ships be radially out from the center of the station, and at an initial position of at least station radius + ship radius + epison?


Q. Boil down / read about the insane and confusing laser mechanics of distance, fuel cost, damage, etc.
     - And also check if there is some kind of "coservation of energy" problem here (not really, just in game resource terms), e.g. how much fuel does it take to make a laser that does 1 unit of damage to a ship, which costs 1 fuel to shield against?

* Game option to prevent docking at enemy bases (set at start time of either the server or observer) (counts as collision with asteroid for damage?)

* Game option to create uranium and vinyl equal to fuel and vinyl carried when a ship is blown up.

* Game option to prevent asteroid dust due to collision - if a collision happens and you can't pick up and it would result in too small due to break, no break.

* Configure number and size of initial asteroids.

1. Add comments throughout on orders:
  * Thrust, Turn, Jettison are mutually exclusive
  * Fire lasers and raise shields be done in any combination with one of the above.

Q. Kobayashi Maru: What if our Ship class overloads the Drift() operator? Can we cheat that way?

??????????????? Find the questions I asked here ?????????????????

Q. Based on DeepThink's answer to Q1 in our doc fuel and other logic implicitly assume dt=1.0, but if the simulation is run with other values velocity and clamping and fuel calculations may be incorrect. How does this interact with our world being run at 0.2 ticks and then laser blasts on the 1s?
  * As cleanup, should we generalize this to tick size and make that a global constant or something?

Q. Based on DeepThink's answer to Q2, the acceleration logic may be flawed, allowing for a final ship velicoty which exceeds maxspeed (I suspect this would quickly be clamped elsewhere, but... (we could add a log message if this ever happens somewhere)). Check the facts on this.

Q. Based on DeepThik's answer to Q3, it claims my two scenarios result in different costs. get to ground truth on that with a hello world type example.

Q. Based on DeepThink's answer to Q4, which is basically "this simple simulation models fuel cost linearly with the angle turned" - think deep throughts about how you might handle this differently. Our rotational inertia is set to 0 at the end of each turn, so to turn theta, we accelerate linearly to 2theta in 1/2 a second and then decelerate, or something like that. What would that cost in reality given our ship mass etc. This would be an add on in our "more realistic physics" package.

Q. Based on DeepThink's answer to Q6/Q7, it agrees dDockDist is kind of stupid, and can create either a walk-out launch wherre we get 5 away each time, or even an infinite loop where we launch with negative velocity.
  Maybe add diagnostic / warning code when we go throug launch cycles? e.g. server announce of each launch and dock and see if we get spammy notices?
  Think deep throughts about:
  * A. What is this even trying to do?
  * B. WOuld it be better to just entirely replace it with a minimum launch distinace of server_radius + ship_radius + fudge factor?
      * Or at least make the launch distance the max of B and what it actually does?

??????????????????????????????????????/

===2===

Add a rule that you can't set jettison orders while docked / you get
back a zero in planning - since you can't jettison while docked why
set the order.

====



Q. Is there a race condition / issue where an asteroid that can't fit can be blown up multiple times by ships that collide with it on the same turn?

Q. How are ties broken / resolved in CShip::HandleCollision for asteroids around like 571 with eating checks? For instance does team1 always get the asteroid if both team1 and team2 are present?

  Q. Question 6: What does the default mode of the switch statement on (ord) in SetOrder do? It looks like maybe it allows you to pass in O_ALL_ORDERS and get the combined fuel for the: shield, laser, and thrust operations on the assumption that they all don’t exhaust each others fuel (which they might in reality).
What do you think the purpose of this is? Is it used anywhere?

  Q. The max laser power in Ship.C's SetOrder seems somewhat arbitrary, and forces laser combat to be close up predominantly (can't shoot at targets at extreme range without rotating to take the closer shot through boundaries, can't pump lots of damage into far ranging targets).

  Q. Team based pBrain and GetBrain do nothing??!?

  Q. Can you mess with other team stuff in your team? Kill their ships, set their messages? Or is the overall loop: server maintans world, sends world copies to teams, teams issue orders, server updates world based on orders, repeat. (Can you issue orders on other teams ships? that the server will do)?

  Q. What is going on in the laser shooting code around line 171-181 in
  World.c, why are we adding a distance of 1 of the targets velocity
  onto the lasThing? Is this an effort to impart momentum due to the
  blast, needed to hit the target? To get the damage correct?
  Something else?
    * It seems like this code should be changed and there should be a
  "nudge" in movement away from the laser, perhaps proportional to
  damage taken or whatever.

  Q. The logic around adding new things to the world based on MAX_THINGS is wrong/broken I think. It ends up not mattering because we are at nowhere near the world limits for the simulation, but for instrance on line 198 we check and bail if numNewThings>=MAX_THINGS; maybe this is a sentinel value check with numNewTHings being interpreted as a UINT with value -1 or something? ACTUALLY - MAYBE THIS IS OK - ITS JUST WEIRDLY CONTROLLED WITH A numNewThings COUNTER?!?

  Q. What is CWorld::SetTeam for? It seems like it's stripping out ships and stations of the other team? And then adding in the ones for the new team? Why bother with all this?

  Q. What is CWorld::CollisionEvaluation doing - these variable names suck - why are there two Collide calls on 311/312 with pTItr&pTTM and the inverse. Fix the dangling unbracketed conditional URes++ on line 313 controlled by prior if.
   * The static apTTmTh is way to cute - either make a better data structure or just accept the N^2 iteration, this is madness as is.

==1==

In Ship.c, line 592 what is going on with the pointer checks against NULL and the explicit NULL assignment of a data member. The
▌ comment claims it prevents an infinite recursive call.
▌
▌ How does this prevent an infinite recursive call, and is there a better/more standard/less confusing way of managin this situation?

• I’m exploring how temporarily nullifying a ship’s team pointer inside HandleCollision in Ship.C prevents infinite recursion when
  two ships collide by blocking symmetrical calls. This clever hack tricks the other ship’s collision check into skipping mutual
  collision handling. Still, I’m thinking it might be cleaner to avoid mutating team pointers and instead use flags or specialized
  one-time collision handlers to prevent recursive calls and ensure safer, more maintainable collision logic.

> - For ship-vs-ship hits, CWorld::CollisionEvaluation already calls both orders: shipA->Collide(shipB) and shipB->Collide(shipA).
  When shipA reaches CShip::HandleCollision, the block at Ship.C:590 runs only if the other ship reports GetTeam()!=NULL.
  - Without the temporary pmyTeam=NULL, shipA would call shipB->Collide(shipA), and inside shipB the same block would run (because
  shipA->GetTeam() is still non-null). That would in turn call shipA->Collide(shipB) again, producing an infinite ping‑pong.
  - Clearing pmyTeam before the call means that, when shipB inspects shipA->GetTeam(), it now sees NULL and skips its reciprocal
  call; the guard is purely there to break the recursion. The pointer is restored afterward so other logic still sees the real team.

  More conventional ways to handle this would avoid mutating game state just to create a guard:

  - Add a per-ship reentrancy flag (e.g., bool processingCollision) that short‑circuits if already set.
  - Let CWorld::CollisionEvaluation call a dedicated symmetric helper once per pair (e.g., HandleShipShipCollision(shipA, shipB))
  instead of bouncing through Collide twice.
  - Pass an explicit parameter or use an overload so the second invocation knows it’s the mirrored call.

  Any of those would be clearer than toggling the team pointer, which is easy to misread (and risky if future logic ever observes the
  NULL mid-call).

####################### END ENGINE TODO ##########################################

========================== Groonew TODO ============================================

0. Is there a hard coded shield max of 30? If so don't add to shields if that would push us over 30? (maybe it's OK as it's effectively a way to jettison fuel before colliding with an asteroid? Or does it clamp us and sometimes we crash into an assteroid?)

0. Consider optimizing initial base launch so we don't all bonk into
each other. Consider initial facing and if it matters which base
you're in. Maybe first 2 turns are always to rotate the ships to cover
an arc towards the center and blast off with max v.

Optimization B: Will the engine calculate cost of our thursts? If so can we just use that in our thust entity thing?

Optimization A: "auction" off best moves and don't duplicate two ships going at the same target - winner is the one who can get there first, tie break on lowest cost.

Optimization C: If there is no or little vinyl left in the world, return to base like for reals my guy if you have vinyl.

Optimization E: If there is no or little vinyl left, and the enemy base has some, go shoot it, if an enemy ship has some, go shoot it.

Does it ever make sense to shoot a asteroid to break it up (other than
perhaps action econmy of getting to smaller chunks a tick earlier?)
how much fuel does it take to break it up, versus how much shield do
you lose and how much fuel to restore shield?

How does our n_turns_vector / n_turns thing actually work?

If we're moving to the right at 1 unit/sec and we want to be at -5 in
5 seconds, then we need to change our velocity to -1 this turn, or
-6/5 next turn, a change of -2 or -11/5, not a change of -5 (or -6) /
5?

How much shields do you need? what is the max damage due to a single collision?

How do lasers work, if you put X fuel in how much damage do you to do something N away?

How do collisions and carried over momentum work?



TOROIDTOROIDTOROID
  Q. General nagivation / logic quersions - what happens near edges -
    if we're pursuing something and it is going to be at 513, which is
    -511, do we follow it straight or turn around - does vector
    operations suddenly say it is PI behind us instead of 0 ahead if
    we were heading to it dead on?



0. I definitely need to consider toroidal approaches in perfect
nagivation - getting shortest distance doesn't give shortest time to
intercept - ESPECIALLY with a max speed.
Consider the 1d case where ships are conceptually on a circle of
circumference L:

Dshort <= L/2
Dlong >= L/2
Best time to intecept short = Dshort / (maxspeed - vtarget)
Best time to intercept long = Dlong / (maxspeed - vtarget)

Ignoring some unit confusion above with speed and velocity, the basic
idea is its very easy for the best time to intercept being along the
long path, if the target is moving away from you at close to maxspeed
- even if you pay a 1 turn penalty for turning around and drifting.

TODO: Formally solve this / come up with a formula / logic to pick
direction.
TOROIDTOROIDTOROID

Minor fix: * The 5 1/5th turns thing is going to cause some trouble
too but that should be a fine detail and our gross 1 turn planning
should hold up well-ish.

NOTE: This is not the engine, this is the Ship.C deciding what order
to send to the server for physics resolution!

**************** GROONEW PERFECT NAV ************************************

* See extensive todos and "Steps" in the documentation of determine
  order in Groonew.C and GetVinyl.C for team Groonew.

* Perfect navigation in Groogroo/MattMatt:
  * Phase 2 - fixes related to 0.2 micro tics between game turns.
  * Handle undocking - the undocking procedure I think gives us a kick
    in position, so our model for where we'll be on turn 1 after
    undocking is wrong with our thurst.
  * Handle negative thrusting and lesser rotations. At least for now
    we don't care what direction we are facing so we should check if
    it's faster to rotate less and then negative thrust.

1. Navigation enhancements: Shortest distance doesn't necessarily mean
fastest time to intercept, and/or cheapest cost. Consider the case
where presently it is only marginally better to go left than right in
terms of distance, however we currently have a large velocity to the
right - we might get there in the same number of turns going right, at
a much reduced cost.
  * Think deep thoughts about magic bag, whereby we want to know for N turns among all possible paths which ones get to the item with the least cost (also possible in the future consider which ones woudl generate the least collisions).
    * Alternatively, add all the paths to the magic bag and magic bag can have multiple things for any target with (path1, nturns, cost), (path2, nturns, cost) ,etc. etc.
      * could weight colisions with our station highly as we get free acceleration?
      * Could consider alternate paths in all cases of: go to station and then launch?

* Deep thoughts for future perfect navigation:
  1. Our current approach assumes if you can't reach destination D with
  one rotation and one thurst in T turns you can't reach it at all in
  T turns.
      * This turns out to be false, there are plenty of times when
      thrust-turn-thrust and maybe other approache are better (even
      leaving aside the stuff that happens with thrust governing
      giving us the ability "turn" in the sense we rotate our velocity
      vector in a somewhat controlled manner without issuing the TURN
      order.
  1. DEEP THINK ON OPTIMAL PATHING IN 2D:
     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AvkE_JgxQ920-TOI9HCcrU0C_781qOoa-mtjaHXHnM/edit?tab=t.0

* Improve Groonew collision detection in determine_orders - we predict
  where thing X will be in N turns, but we could also check if thing X
  is going to collide with something before N turns, and if so not
  bother trying to intercept it at a place it won't likely to be in
  those turns.

* Improve Groonew collision handling. As it is it iterates over the
  world and locks orders and maybe breaks if it detects certain
  scenarios - but really we want to consider all collisions ordered
  from soonest to latest or something like that. The current logic
  nondeterministically identifies one of the things we're colliding
  with soon and plans based on that - we can do better.

**************** END GROONEW PERFECT NAV ************************************

1. Brain enhancements - we can call SetOrder to get the fuel cost of
an order, and then ResetOrders to clear it out (I think) rather than
figuring the fuel costs independenty on our own.

1. For Codex branch, check if Team Ares is using toroidal logic,
suggest it to use the relevant thing/ship primatives which do that
correctly.

What is the inheritance hierarchy for our project:

Asteroid, Laser, Ship, Station IS A Thing

CTeam HAS A:
  * CWorld (pmyWorld)
  * CBrain (pBrain)
  * Array of CShips (apShips)
  * CStation (pStation)

Player teams IS A CTeam

Thing is base class for Asteroid, Ship, Station, and Laser

CShips have:
  * Ship physics:
    * A ships mass is 40 + its fuel + its vinyl
  * Costs and limits (other than default fuel limits)
    * Shield increase 1:1 with fuel spent
    * Lasers cost the value to be fired / 50
    * Thrusting costs the magnitude of the new velocity after the acceleration is applied * current ship mass (see above) / 6*maxspeed*empty_ship_mass = 6*30*40 = 7200. (New velocity vector limited by maxspeed)
      * Thrusting out of a docked position is free, however may be gated based off max fuel size
    * Turning costs the O_TURN provided |value| * ship mass / 12*PI*empty ship mass = 480*Pi - turning SETS THE SHIPS ROTATION TO THE O_TURN AMOUNT IN RADIANS PER SECOND.
    * Jettison costs nothing for vinyl, and the amount jettisoned for fuel.
  * Members: myNum, bDockFlag, dDockDist, dLaserDist, pBrain, arrays of: adOrders, adStatCur, atStatMax
  * Methods (among others like establish capacities):
    * Drift - handles order proceeeing on the ships turn:
      * 1st Jettisons stuff, if any
      * 2nd updates sields, if any
      * Then turns, if any
      * Then thrusts, if any
      * Then updates position
    * AsteroidFits
    * LaserTarget (Purportedly what laserbeam will hit if fired) - does so only if the ship is facing along the shortest straight line path - which is not a catastrophe given our 512 length max laser, but is inconsisntent in that it will report targets that can't be reached (due to short requested laser length or fuel constraints) on the shortest path as we face, but not any (definitionally unreachable due to max beam length) tarets on the longer paths that we face.
      * This logic may in fact be the reason for the 512 max beam length (also a 1024 or larger beam will hit yourself if it hits nothing else)
    * GetLaserBeamDistance (purportedly the distance the beam will traverse)
    * AngleToIntercept - Seems to correctly compute the angle we need to turn to _FACE_ another target next turn taking both our velocites into account, and assuming they stay the same - but this will not do correct vector math I think.

    * IsFacing <- True if overlap (buggy due to FP stuff), otherwise establishes a coordinate system with our ship at the origin, and then draws a line on our facing out to DistTo(Other) distance and sees if that point is within the radius of the other object.
    * HandleCollision (virtual)

Physics Engine:

The server's game loop:
while (time < 300.0) { Simulation(); BroadcastWorld(); ReceiveTeamOrders(); }

The team client's game loop:
while (connected) { ReceivedWorld(); DoTurn(); }
  * the Client's DoTurn() gets data
    * calls Team::Reset()
      * The Team::Reset() method calls ResetOrder() on each ship.
    * calls Team::Turn()
      * This method does nothing by default, teams provide their own
        implementation.
    * then sends info back to the server.

SO WE DO ALL OF THIS:
The server's Simulation() does:
  1. The world's PhysicsModel() with a small tstep (0.2) 5 times.
  2. After the 5th call, when 1 second has elapsed, it calls the world's LaserModel() which handles laser collision, adding new and killing dead things.

At each step the PhysicsModel does:
  1. For each thing their Drift(dt) method which is 0.2 in our example
  2. CollisionEvaluation()
  3. AddNewThings()
  4. KillDeadThings()

In the Drift step above:
  1. CShip::Drift:
     * clamps to maxspeed
     * Does orders in this sequence: Jettison, Shields, Turn, Thrust (which in turn will change Vel if a thrust occurs, and change omega of a turn occurs)
     * Changes position and orientation by Vel*dt and omega*dt
     * Sets omega and dLaserDist to zero
  2. Asteroids just do the default CThing behavior of move/rotate dt.
== THEN WE GET NEW ORDERS AND REPEAT ===

Coordinates:

CTraj has a rho (magnitude) and theta (direction):
  * Can ConvertToCort and be created FromCord:
    * Convert to cord makes x = rho*cos(theta) and y follows sin - so "convert to cord" gives you the coordinate this vector points to from the origin.
    * FromCoord also assumes the coordinates are relative to the origin and computes the vector.
  * Normalize() - Keeps -PI < theta < PI and rho  > 0
Notes:
  * Defines const doubles for PI and PI2.

CCord has an x and a y position, and methods:
  * cc.DistTo( occ ) Shortest distance taking toroidal geometry into account
  * cc.AngleTo( occ ) Proper heading for shortest distance taking toroidal geometry into account
  * cc.VectTo( occ ) returns a CTraj object with a vector to the other point
  * cc.Normalize() for putting coordinates into the game field
Notes:
  * Coord.h defines the playing field boundary as -512 to 512 with const doubles fW[X|Y][Max|Min]

=== SERVER / CLIENT LOGIC ===

  Client-Server Architecture

  1. Team Binary Compilation: Each team (like ChromeFunk) is compiled into the mm4team binary. The key is that
   CTeam::CreateTeam() in ChromeFunk.C:10 returns a ChromeFunk instance, linking the team's AI logic into the
  binary.
  2. World State Management:
    - Server maintains authoritative world state (all ships, asteroids, stations)
    - Client receives complete world snapshots via ReceiveWorld() which calls pmyWorld->SerialUnpack()
  (Client.C:166)
    - The initial world creation in Client.C constructor is just placeholder - immediately replaced when
  MeetWorld() connects to server
  3. Game Loop Flow:
  Client (mm4team.C:28-29):
  1. ReceiveWorld() - Get full world state from server
  2. DoTurn() - Execute team AI and send orders back
  4. Team Logic Execution (Client.C:204-217):
    - DoTurn() calls pTm->Turn() which executes ChromeFunk's strategic AI
    - ChromeFunk::Turn() iterates through ships calling pSh->GetBrain()->Decide()
    - Each brain's Decide() sets ship orders (thrust, turn, fire, etc.)
    - Orders are packed via SerialPack() and sent to server
  5. State Synchronization:
    - From Server: Full world state including all ship positions/velocities/cargo/shields
    - To Server: Only ship orders (thrust amount, turn amount, fire commands)
    - Server simulates physics and combat, then broadcasts updated world state

  The team AI (ChromeFunk) never directly modifies world state - it only reads state and generates orders. The
   server is authoritative for all physics and game state changes.

  One Time Team Initialization Protocol

  When a team client connects (Client.C:129-135), it:

  1. Calls Init() - Team sets names and capacities (ChromeFunk.C:36-56):
    - Team name: "Chrome Funkadelic"
    - Station name: "HeartLand"
    - Ship names: "SS TurnTable", "Bell Bottoms", etc.
    - Ship capacities: 45.0 fuel, 15.0 cargo
  2. Packs initialization data via SerPackInitData() (Team.C:243-272) which sends:
    - Team number
    - Team name
    - Station name
    - For each ship:
        - Cargo capacity
      - Fuel capacity
      - Ship name
  3. Server receives and unpacks this data using SerUnpackInitData() (Team.C:274-307), which:
    - Sets all the names on server-side objects
    - Configures ship capacities
    - Initializes fuel to max capacity and shields to 15.0

  This is a one-time handshake during connection. After this, the server knows all team/ship/station names and
   ship capacities, allowing it to:
  - Enforce cargo limits during pickup operations
  - Track fuel consumption based on configured capacity
  - Display correct names in observer views
  - Manage team-specific station operations

  The team binary configures these values in Init(), but they're immediately transmitted to and stored by the
  server, which becomes the authoritative source for all game mechanics involving these properties.

==== ChromeFunk Brain Approach ====

The CBrain hierarchy in ChromeFunk demonstrates a context-switching AI pattern using
  temporary brain replacements. Here's the design:

  Brain Hierarchy

  CBrain (base class)
  ├── Voyager    - Station departure specialist (temporary)
  ├── Stalker    - Navigation/interception
  ├── Shooter    - Combat (inherits from Stalker)
  └── Gatherer   - Resource collection (inherits from Shooter)

  The Brain-Swapping Pattern

  The key insight is in Voyager (lines 43-54, 56-81):

  1. Temporary replacement: Voyager stores the previous brain (pLastBrain) and installs itself
  2. Self-deletion: Once undocked, Voyager deletes itself, automatically restoring the previous
   brain via its destructor
  3. Example flow: Gatherer → Voyager → Gatherer

  This happens in Gatherer::Decide() at line 343:
  if (pShip->IsDocked()) {
      new Voyager(this);  // Creates Voyager, which replaces Gatherer temporarily
      return;             // Voyager handles departure, then restores Gatherer
  }

  Requirements That Led to This Design

  This implementation suggests these requirements:

  1. Specialized behaviors: Different tasks need completely different decision logic (docking
  vs combat vs gathering)
  2. State preservation: Ships need to return to their previous behavior after temporary tasks
  3. Clean transitions: No complex state machines or if/else chains cluttering the main logic
  4. Reusable components: Shooter extends Stalker, Gatherer extends Shooter - building
  complexity through inheritance
  5. Self-managing contexts: Behaviors know when they're done and clean up after themselves

  The pattern allows ships to have a "stack" of behaviors - push a temporary brain for special
  situations (like undocking), then pop back to the previous behavior automatically. It's
  elegant for handling context switches without losing the ship's primary mission.

===============

Dubins' Result: The shortest path between any two positions+orientations is one of only 6 types:

LSL, RSR, LSR, RSL, RLR, LRL

Advanced: Reeds-Shepp Vehicle
Like Dubins but can reverse:

Adds backward segments
48 types of optimal paths instead of 6
Used for parking, tight maneuvering

Q. Can you cheat by setting things like ship velocity, asteroid size,
base vinyl, etc.?
A. You can set these things, but your team is running in a client
which gets a private version of the world each tick from the
server. The server recieves your orders and processes physics based on
them, and resends the updated world, so you can't cheat this way.

Q. Can you cheat by manipulating the raw orders set rather than using
SetOrder?
A. Yes, with limited success: you can create a derived class of CShip
that has no private data members (and hence the same memory layout as
CShip) with members that cast a CShip via C style casting or
reinterpret cast to be your derived class and return pointers to the
undostats and order arrays for direct manipulation, however:
  * adStat values are ignored by the server from the client's data
  * adOrders are processed - so you can do things like set multiple
    orders or set magnitudes you wouldn't have been allowed to, but
    the server then replays most of orders through the Ship.C's
    SetOrders which enforces the rules. It is possible you could
    trigger a corner case here, but the design of SetOrders is
    intended to be robust against this.
  * However, the legacy engine implementation of LaserModel does allow
    an exploit here - it powers the laser with whatever has been set
    in the order, and fires it with that amount, and only later does
    it deduct fuel.

Q. Can you cheat by issuing multiple commands whose combined fuel cost
exceeds available fuel but still get their benefits?

A. Generally no - but there is again a special case with the Laser
implementation. The legacy engine will effectively do this:
1. Raise shields by full requested amount, deducting the fuel required.
2. Do the first subtick (0.2) seconds of Thurst or Turn if one is specified, deducting the fuel required.
3. Shoot lasers based on the input command value, then figure fuel.
4. Do the remainin subticks of Thurst/Turn.
In step 3 you can exceed your fuel alotment - especially if you raised
shields. Lasers are effectively "free" on any turn where you'd run out
of fuel before the 2nd physics tick anyway.
