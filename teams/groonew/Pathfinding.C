  //         in the case where we plan a drift intercept. If we're planning to
  //         drift we should see if anything will collide with us _before_ our
  //         target does. More broadly for all case where we drift for a turn we
  //         should check if anything other than what we're trying to hit
  //         collides first and return failure.
  
  // Step 1: Think about our treatment of time as a double below - are we
  // creating signpost problems where we are cutting things too close and are
  // going to be 1 turn late on stuff (or 1 turn early?)

  // Step 3: Consider how to make planning stable so we don't pingping between
  // targets with equal distance from us, e.g. we pick asteroid A that is 4
  // turns away this turn (but B is also 4 turns away) and plan to intercept A,
  // but next round we pick asteroid B (both A and B now 3 turns away) and turn
  // again, etc. and never execute on a plan for either.0

  // Step 3: Consider how to make the logic toroid aware and relative velocity
  // aware - e.g. ship at -200, asteroid at 200, ship going 30 left, asteroid
  // going 30 right - if we do nothing we'll collide in ~624/60 = 11 turns. But
  // if we chase it by turning to the right we'll never cath it.

  // Step 3: Consider how to adapt the logic for the actual collision detection
  // accounting for object radius.

  // Step 3: Consider where we need to special case things below for IsDocked
  // for optimal handling (already have a check in the Case 1a because nothing
  // collides with us while docked.)

  // Step 2: Adapt the logic given that the underlying simulation uses dt=0.2.

    The idea in this part of the code is to implement a sort of greedy
    pathfinding algorithm.

    We consider exhastively (I think?) the cases for a 2 turn planniing horizon
    to intercept thing.

    Time is an upper bound. Normally we aim to arrive exaclty in time, because
    our architecture calls this function iteratively for lower times, so we
    don't need to worry about doing better than time here. That being said, for
    case 1a and 2ai we might arrive early.

    Note that this approach will not, in general, produce optimal shortest time
    paths in all scenarios. That is something to refine later.

    It differs from legacy Groogroo in that legacy Groogroo more or less ignored
    the engine limits and just assumed any thrust up to 30 was obtainable, and
    course corrected en route for any game engine interference with those plans.

    Here we explicitly consider how the overthrust mechanics work and try to use
    them to get on desired trajectories. We ignore for now the implementation
    details of the 5 engine subticks and plan at the turn level, leaving subtick
    analysis for future enhancement.

    If require_facing is true, we only consider trajectories where the ship
    will be facing the target (cases 1b, 1c, 2b). This is useful for combat
