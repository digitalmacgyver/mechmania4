// This will be the first thing we refine:
// Step 0: As I'm checking the stuff below, I want to validate with hello world style code checks, for instance that VectTo does what I expect.
// Step 0: CONSIDER USING A NEW SHIP, SETTING IT'S POSITION AND VELOCITY, AND USING DETECT COLLISION OR OTHER METHODS TO DO THE NON-POINT MASS ANALYSI
//         MAYBE WE CAN USE DETECTCOLISIONCOURSE INSTEAD OF THETA <= 0.1
// Step 1: Check and validate the logic below is correct and optimal for point masses and dt=1.
//         * Account for max velocity - we'll get clamped to 30 so don't chase stuff we can't catch - if our resulting vel > 30 to get there in time t fail or limit to 30.
//         * Double check engine behavior - it seems it allows us to acclerate to > 30, by going up to 30 in each dimension or soemthing - this will quickly get capped later but understand current behavior for that tick.
//         * After making some fixes, it seems we're chasing things - is there an off by 1 error where we're 1 second behind? Or a failure to recognize when we're on maxspeed?
//           IT'S PROBABLY A MAXSPEED ISSUE - NEED HELLO WORLD DIAGNOSIS OF TRYING TO CHASE SOMETHING JUST AHEAD OF US GOING AT MAXSPEED.
//           IT MAY ALSO BE A FACING ISSUE - WHEN WE ARE CLOSE WE MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY DEAD ON BUT WE MAY WASTE TURNS DOING TINY MICRO ADJUSTMENTS INSTEAD OF THRUSTING.
//           THE OLD LOGIC OF DIVIDING BY TIME INSTEAD OF (TIME-1) MAY HAVE MASKED THIS ISSUE BY OVERSHOOTING THE TARGET ON APPROACH.
// Step 2: Adapt the logic given that the underlying simulation uses dt=0.2.
// Step 3: Consider how to make our estimates fuel aware, and our order selections fuel aware.
// Step 3: Consider how to prevent two ships going after the same target, and making the one who can get there best (e.g. fastest and with least fuel) the one who gets it.
// Step 3: Consider how to make the logic toroid aware and relative velocity aware - e.g. ship at -200, asteroid at 200, ship going 30 left, asteroid going 30 right - if we do nothing we'll collide in ~624/60 = 11 turns. But if we chase it by turning to the right we'll never cath it.
// Step 3: Consider how to adapt the logic for the actual size of our objects.
// Step 4: Consider how to adapt logic to be collision aware.

  DEBUG - we need to adapt to new physics here - right now we refuse to thrust if
  we can't get there in time even if we're on the right heading. But it may be that 
  thursting on that heading this turn puts us:

  !!!NEXT STEP - LETS THINK ABOUT OVERTHRUSTS THAT CAN PUT US ON THE TRAJECTORY WE WANT,
  AND REASON ABOUT OUR TIME TO ARRIVE BY LOOKING AT OUR VELOCITY ON THAT TRAJ THIS TURN +
  30 ON FUTURE TURNS.!!! This is promising.


     a. In a position to get there on future turns.
     b. So here we're starting to think about optimal paths...
     c. Before going full optimal path, maybe there is a better heuristic we can do for a 2-4 turn planning horizon.
        Right now we consider 1-2 turns, either thrust now, or turn and then thrust.
        We should consider:
          Drift
          Thrust
          Drift, Drift
          Thrust, Drift
          Thrust, Thurst
          Turn, Thrust
          Drift, Drift, Drift
          Drift, Drift, Thrust
          Drift, Thrust, Drift
          Dirft, Thrust, Thrust
          Thrust, Drift, Drift
          Thrust, Drift, Thrust
          Thrust, Thrust, Drift
          Thrust, Thrust, Thrust
          Thrust, Turn, Thrust
          Turn, Drift, Thrust
          Turn, Thrust, Drift
          Turn, Thrust, Thrust

          My intuition tells me the other options are redundant other than facing (facing could set us up for optimal paths), but here Im trying to think of a quick fix that could dramatically improve groonew without going all the way to optimal paths.


  // Check if we're already facing the right direction and thrust is reasonable
  // TODO: We sometimes rotate around in a circle for nearby flybys, rather than
  // having a fixed arc of 0.1, we should try something more precise - perhaps
  // we can use the laser systems facing logic to see if we'll just get it of we
  // thrust (probablyu should limit that to 1 turn lookahead).
  if (fabs(thrust_vec_now.theta) < .1) {
    if (!is_speeding(ship, thrust_vec_now.rho)) { 
      // We're aligned - thrust immediately
      fj.order_kind = O_THRUST;
      fj.order_mag = thrust_vec_now.rho;
      fj.fuel_used = ship->SetOrder(O_THRUST, thrust_vec_now.rho);
    } else {
      // Can't reach target - thrust required exceeds maximum
      fj.fuel_used = -1;  // Signal impossible trajectory
    }
  } else {
    // STRATEGY 2: Turn now, thrust next turn
    // Calculate what we'll need if we spend this turn rotating
    if (time <= 1.0) {
      fj.fuel_used = -1;  // Signal impossible trajectory
    } else {
      CTraj dist_vec_later = us_later.VectTo(destination);
      CTraj vel_vec_later = dist_vec_later;
      vel_vec_later.rho /= (time - 1.0);  // Required velocity from next position

      // Our current velocity won't change if we only rotate
      CTraj thrust_vec_later = vel_vec_later - ship->GetVelocity();
      thrust_vec_later.theta = thrust_vec_later.theta - ship->GetOrient();

      if (is_speeding(ship, thrust_vec_later.rho)) {
        // Can't reach target - thrust required exceeds maximum
        fj.fuel_used = -1;  // Signal impossible trajectory
      } else {
        // Turn this frame to face target
        fj.order_kind = O_TURN;
        fj.order_mag = thrust_vec_later.theta;
