# Team Groogather Strategy Guide

## Team Overview
**Name:** "Groogather!"
**Team Number:** 14
**Authors:** Matt (10/2025)
**Philosophy:** "Groogroo don't eat Groogroo; Groogroo do."

In this team we build on the original Team Groogroo's excellent navigation and resource collection, and is a snapshot of that project which encapsulates:

* Good pathfinding
* Decent emergency orders handling

It does not have the aggressive attack based logic of other Groo* teams, in keeping with the original Team Groogroo, and it doesn't use knowledge of engine internals to fly better.
