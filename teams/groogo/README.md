# Team Groogo Strategy Guide

## Team Overview
**Name:** "Groogo!"
**Team Number:** 14
**Authors:** Matt (10/2025)
**Philosophy:** "Groogroo don't eat Groogroo; Groogroo do."

Groogo is faster and more aggressive than Groogather, but it's combat systems are rudimentary.

In this team we build on the original Team Groogroo's excellent navigation and resource collection, and is a snapshot of that project which encapsulates:

* Good pathfinding
* Navigational enhancements that exploit knowledge of the engine (fast undocks, overthrusting to achieve desired positions based on the number of engine sub-ticks per turn)
* Decent emergency orders handling
* Rudimentary endgame aggression with mediocre to bad enemy station and ship targeting.
