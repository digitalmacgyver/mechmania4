# Test 1: Ship-Station Collision
# Purpose: Test ship colliding back with its own station after launching
#
# Setup:
# - Team 1: noop (does nothing)
# - Team 2: testteam executing these orders
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Turn 1: Ship rotates to face station (turn 3π/4 from initial 0)
# - Turns 2-5: Ship "walks out" of station with small reverse thrust (-5)
#   * In legacy mode, may see repeated docking events as dDockDist increments
# - Turn 6: Ship thrusts forward (30) toward station
#   * Should collide with station after turn 6
#
# Format: shipnum,turn,ORDER_KIND,magnitude

# Ship initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)
# Station is at origin, so turn π radians to face it (west/left)
# Then offset by -π/4 to prepare for the approach angle
# Net turn: π - π/4 = 3π/4 ≈ 2.356

# Turn 1: Rotate to face station
0,1,O_TURN,2.356

# Turns 2-5: Walk out of station with reverse thrust
# (negative thrust moves backward relative to current orientation)
