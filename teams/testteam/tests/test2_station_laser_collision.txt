# Test 2: Station-Laser Collision
# Purpose: Test laser hitting station
#
# Setup:
# - Team 1: noop (does nothing)
# - Team 2: testteam executing these orders
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Turns 1-5: Same as Test 1 - ship moves away from station
# - Turn 6: Ship fires laser at maximum range toward station
#   * Should hit station on turn 6
#
# Format: shipnum,turn,ORDER_KIND,magnitude

# Ship initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)
# Turn to face station (west/left) offset by -π/4
# Net turn: π - π/4 = 3π/4 ≈ 2.356

# Turn 1: Rotate to face station
0,1,O_TURN,2.356

# Turns 2-5: Walk out of station with reverse thrust
0,2,O_THRUST,-5
0,3,O_THRUST,-5
0,4,O_THRUST,-5
0,5,O_THRUST,-5

# Turn 6: Fire laser at maximum power (512 units range)
# Laser strength is the order magnitude
0,6,O_LASER,512
