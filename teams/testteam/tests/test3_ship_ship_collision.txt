# Test 3: Ship-Ship Collision
# Purpose: Test two ships colliding with each other
#
# Setup:
# - Team 1: noop (does nothing)
# - Team 2: testteam executing these orders
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Ship 0: Moves away from Team 2 station, then returns (like Test 1)
# - Ship 1: Rotates opposite direction and thrusts to intercept Ship 0
# - Ships should collide sometime on or after turn 6
#
# Format: shipnum,turn,ORDER_KIND,magnitude

# Ship 0 initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)
# Ship 1 initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)

# Turn 1: Ship 0 rotates toward station, Ship 1 rotates opposite way
# Ship 0: turn 3π/4 to face station direction
0,1,O_TURN,2.356
# Ship 1: turn -π/4 to face away from station in different direction
1,1,O_TURN,-0.785

# Turns 2-5: Ship 0 walks out, Ship 1 does nothing (stays docked)

# Turn 6: Ship 0 returns toward station, Ship 1 launches and accelerates
