# Test 5: Ship-Laser Collision (Extra Credit)
# Purpose: Test laser hitting a ship
#
# Setup:
# - Team 1: noop (does nothing)
# - Team 2: testteam executing these orders
#
# Expected Behavior:
# - Ship 0: Positions itself away from station
# - Ship 1: Aims and fires laser at Ship 0
# - Laser should hit Ship 0, causing damage
#
# Format: shipnum,turn,ORDER_KIND,magnitude

# Ship 0 initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)
# Ship 1 initial orient = 0.0 (facing east/right)

# Turn 1: Ship 0 rotates to 3π/4, Ship 1 rotates to same angle to aim at Ship 0

# Turns 2-5: Ship 0 moves away to become a target

# Turn 6: Ship 0 stops, Ship 1 adjusts aim slightly and fires
# Ship 1 needs to aim at where Ship 0 is now
# Since both started at same position and Ship 0 moved at 3π/4,
# Ship 1 should face same direction and fire

# Turns 7-10: Continue the pattern to ensure hit
# Ship 0 continues moving slowly
