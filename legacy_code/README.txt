This directory contains the legacy code from team Groogroo's mechmania
contest for the UIUC Mechmania IV: The Vinyl Frontier programming
contest in 1998.

This code is not used and is included for historic reference only.

Original Server Code:
  * mm4/
  * mm4.tar (an archive of the mm4/ directory)

Team Groogroo Code:
  * team13/
  * team13.tar (an archive of the team13/ directory)

I am not sure if this is our furthest developed code for the contest,
or just what I was able to snapshot at some time.

The contents of groogroo3/ and team/ seem to be identical and the
lastest code, whereas groogroo2/ seems to be an older version.

I have a strong recollection of having code to fire on asteroids just
before collisions, and that is not implemented here, so perhaps there
was subsequent development done - however the core of the magic bag
and vinyl harvesting seems to be working well.

team13.tar should just be a copy of what is in team13/
