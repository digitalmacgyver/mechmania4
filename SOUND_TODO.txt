Sound System Roadmap (SDL_mixer Integration)
===========================================

Overall Goal
------------
Migrate the MechMania observer to an SDL_mixer-based audio stack that can:
- decode WAV/MP3/MOD (optionally Ogg) via a single cross-platform API,
- respect advanced playback behaviors (queue, delay, scale) configured in sound/defaults.txt,
- keep music running continuously while enforcing per-tick rules for sound effects.

Current Status
--------------
- ✅ Build now tolerates missing system SDL_mixer by stubbing playback and warning at configure time.
- ✅ Vendoring script updated to capture SDL2_mixer alongside other SDL deps for offline installs.
- ✅ AudioSystem scaffolding present (initialization, request buffering, logging).
- ✅ SoundLibrary parses defaults.txt using a custom indentation parser; it captures file paths, queue/delay/scale metadata, and supports per-event fallback lookups.
- ✅ AudioEventTracker emits effect requests with quantities and team-local logical IDs (e.g. team1.launch.default).
- ✅ defaults.txt demonstrates new schema (file + behavior with queue/delay/scale) and inherit semantics.
- ✅ Default soundtrack now seeds assets/star_control/music/hyper.mod to exercise SDL_mixer playback.
- ✅ EffectRequest delay/loop hints now come from SoundLibrary descriptors when enqueuing playback requests, and queue-mode flags reach the buffer.
- ✅ Observer footer exposes audio mute (M) and effects (E) toggles with real-time status indicators.
- ✅ AudioSystem scheduler enforces delay/queue semantics with Mix channel dispatch and logs scheduling when SDL_mixer is unavailable.

To-Do / Next Steps
------------------
1. **Menu interaction sounds**
   - Introduce logical events (`menu.toggle.enabled`, `menu.toggle.disabled`, etc.) and map them to `menusnd01-04.wav` with alternating playback.
   - Ensure the first toggle uses “A” (menusnd01) and the second uses “B” (menusnd02); continue alternating if the control keeps flipping.
   - When effects are muted, play a single confirmation click then suppress further menu audio until effects are re-enabled.
   - Update `sound/defaults.txt` and AudioSystem helpers so menu sounds respect the mute state rule.

2. **Finalize Star Control effect coverage**
   - Fill the remaining schema items from the pseudo-config (e.g., `launch_from_enemy`, `jettison_vinyl/uranium`, `dock_at_enemy` including `redalert.wav`).
   - Encode loop/delay/queue semantics: laser loop duration tied to order magnitude, deliver_vinyl loop scaled by payload, queue mode for sequential collisions/docks.
  - Verify both teams inherit sane defaults while honoring overrides (Team 1 vs Team 2 variation).

3. **Observer startup muting (`--mute`)**
   - Add CLI flag that starts the observer with both music/effects muted but still allows the UI to unmute.
   - Update help text, argument plumbing, panel state, and footer indicators.
   - Ensure menu sounds and soundtrack respect the startup mute state.

4. **Random soundtrack cycling + “[N]ext song” control**
   - Shuffle through `arilou.mod`, `arispace.mod`, `battle.mod`, `comandr.mod`, `hyper.mod`, `introx.mod`, `outfit.mod`, `pkunk.mod`, `shipyard.mod`.
   - When a track finishes (or “[N]ext song” is pressed), choose an unplayed track until all have been heard, then reshuffle.
   - Insert a “[N]ext song” control above the mute row, expanding the panel layout as needed.
   - Emit verbose logs for track transitions so tests can assert behaviour.

5. **Testing & validation**
   - Extend `test7.sh` once menu/playlist logging is in place (potentially send automated key events).
   - Document manual QA: toggling menu items, verifying ping behaviour with new flag, checking soundtrack rotation.

Open Questions
--------------
- Decide whether YAML parsing should move to a third-party library (yaml-cpp) or keep the current indent-based parser long-term.
- Determine default duration_ticks when unspecified (current behavior treats 0 as "play to completion").
- Clarify how inheritance should behave when behavior attributes are omitted in the child.

Immediate Diagnostics
---------------------
- Validate menu sound logic once implemented (confirm alternating playback and mute suppression).
- Verify soundtrack shuffling logs track IDs for `[N]ext song` and natural transitions.
- Ensure new logical events appear in verbose logs so integration tests can latch onto them.

Automation & Tooling Updates
----------------------------
- `scripts/test_collision_modes.py`: already accepts observer flags; extend scripted scenarios if we need to fire the “[N]ext song” control automatically.
- Consider adding a lightweight menu-audio regression script that toggles mute/effects via simulated inputs (optional future work).

Validation Workflow
-------------------
1. `cmake -S . -B build` (no extra flags once vendoring auto-runs) then `cmake --build build`.
2. `teams/testteam/tests/test7.sh --observer-enable-audio-test-ping` – confirm launch audio, ping diagnostics, and (eventually) menu/soundtrack logging.
3. Manual QA: exercise mute toggles, `[N]ext song`, and verify menu sounds respect the mute state; optionally run `./build/mm4_modtest -s ...` for codec smoke tests.

Upcoming Debugging Tasks
------------------------
- Define menu event IDs and fire them from the observer UI handlers.
- Revisit `AudioEventTracker` for outstanding pseudo-config events (e.g., friendly/enemy launches, jettison variations) to ensure they emit the correct logical IDs.
- Add soundtrack playlist management (shuffle queue) and wire `[N]ext song` keyboard shortcut + UI label.
