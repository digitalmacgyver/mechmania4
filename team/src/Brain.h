/* Brain.h
 * Strategic Context Switching System for AI Behaviors
 *
 * The Brain system implements a strategic context switching pattern where:
 * - Teams analyze strategic situations and select appropriate tactical
 * behaviors
 * - Brains execute focused, goal-oriented AI for specific contexts
 * - Ships can dynamically switch between different behavioral contexts
 *
 * Design Intent:
 * - Teams handle strategic decisions ("What should we be doing?")
 * - Brains handle tactical execution ("How do we do it?")
 * - Enables modular, reusable AI behaviors for different game contexts
 *
 * Example contexts: GetVinylEarlyGame, AttackEnemyShipLateGame,
 *                   GetVinylLowFuelEarlyGame, DefendStation, etc.
